* Always start with identifying the 'smallest valuable increment'
* Always work TDD: red/green/refactor
* Always leave the code in a better state than when you started
* Always abstract away environment operations like file, process, time so tests can mock them.
* Always inject timestamps into function calls so tests can excercise with known values
